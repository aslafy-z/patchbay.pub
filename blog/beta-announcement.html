      <h1>TL;DR</h1>

      The patchbay API is changing a bit, but also stabilizing to 1.0, in order
      to add exciting new features. patchbay is currently running in
      compatibility mode. One week from today, we're flipping the switch. Between
      now and then, you'll need to change any MPMC (ie non-pubsub) requests to
      use the patchbay.pub/queue/ base route. pubsub=true will continue to work,
      but is considered deprecated and will be removed in the future. It is
      recommended to switch to patchbay.pub/pubsub/ as soon as possible.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        When patchbay
        <a target='_blank' href='./introducing-patchbay.html'>launched</a>
        a couple weeks ago, it was a cool idea, and even
        provided some useful primitives for connecting things over the web.
        However, the API was a bit hacky, and the system was missing some key
        functionality that kept it reaching its true potential.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today we're announcing patchbay 1.0. This represents a stabilization and
        normalization of the API, and exciting new features, without removing
        the simplicity and elegance that makes patchbay appealing in the first
        place. Before we discuss the specifics of what is changing, I want to
        walk through a motivating example.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most interesting example when patchbay was launched was the ability
        to host a static web site using nothing but bash. It looks something like
        this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>
