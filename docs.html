      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        patchbay is a generic service for connecting things over the web.
        Traditionally, the web works by having a single server with some code
        running on it. Clients (usually browsers) connect to the server and it
        responds with web pages. Servers will also often do some processing in
        response to the requests it receives, for example changing information
        in a database, or converting a video.
      </p>

      <p>
        patchbay can do everything a normal web server can do. The key
        difference is that instead of the server being set ahead of time,
        patchbay allows you to easily control the client <em>and</em> the
        server from your own devices. So any device can play the role of a
        client, or a server (or both!).
      </p>

      <h1>Protocols and Channels</h1>

      <p>
        patchbay works by providing a few simple protocols on top of HTTP. These
        protocols can be used to model many different communication patterns
        between programs. The currently supported protocols are PubSub,
        Multi-Producer/Multi-Consumer Queues (MPMC), Requester, and Responder.
        Each protocol is accessed by making the appropriate
        HTTP requests to patchbay.pub, like this:
      </p>
      -->

      <h1>Protocols</h1>

      patchbay currently implements 4 different protocols: PubSub,
      Multi-Producer/Multi-Consumer Queues, Requester, and Responder.

      <!--
      <ul>
        <li>
          PubSub:
          https://patchbay.pub/pubsub/
        </li>
        <li>
          MPMC:
          https://patchbay.pub/queue/
        </li>
        <li>
          Requester:
          https://patchbay.pub/req/
        </li>
        <li>
          Responder:
          https://patchbay.pub/res/
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In additional to the protocol, it's also necessary to specify a
        channel. Channels are usually randomly generated by you. Actual request
        endpoints look more like this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          PubSub:
          https://patchbay.pub/pubsub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          MPMC:
          https://patchbay.pub/queue/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Requester:
          https://patchbay.pub/req/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Responder:
          https://patchbay.pub/res/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      -->

      <h2>PubSub</h2>

      <p>
        To subscribe to a pubsub channel, make a request like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/pubsub/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Then, to publish a message to all subscribers on that channel:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/pubsub/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -d "Hi there"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        It can be useful to keep the connection open, rather than curl exiting
        after each received message. That can be accomplished using
        persist=true (be sure to disable curl buffering for small messages):
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl 'https://patchbay.pub/pubsub/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span>?persist=true' --no-buffer
      </code></pre>

      <h2>MPMC Queues</h2>

      <p>
        An MPMC producer is creating by POSTing to the /mpmc/ protocol:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/mpmc/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -d "Hi there"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Unlike pubsub publishers, producers will block until a consumer patches
        in to the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        A consumer is created by GETing:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/mpmc/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span>
      </code></pre>

      <h2 id='reqres'>Requester/Responder</h2>

      <p>
        Requester/Responder (req/res) is where the full power of patchbay is
        unlocked. In its simple form, it can be used almost exactly like MPMC:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/req/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span>
      </code></pre>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/res/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -d "Hi there"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        There are 2 key features of req/res that give it far more power than
        MPMC:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Clients have access to the full range of HTTP methods (POST, PUT,
            DELETE, etc), instead of just GET.
          </li>
          <li>
            The request path is passed through to responders, so they can
            change behavior based on it.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples below.
      </p>

      <h3>Requester POST</h3>

      What if you wanted to upload some data to your server? With req/res you
      can send data in both directions:

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/req/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -d "Data"
      </code></pre>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/res/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -d "Thanks for the data" > file.txt
      </code></pre>

      <h3>Request Headers and Path</h3>

      Here's where things get really cool. To have a fully-functional web
      server, we need access to more information about the client request, for
      example the request path, headers, query parameters, etc. Run the simple
      req/res examples again, but this time add -v to the responder:

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/req/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -d "Data"
      </code></pre>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/res/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span> -v -d "Thanks for the data" > file.txt
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        curl will print out information about the headers received from the
        patchbay server:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
< HTTP/2 200
< access-control-allow-origin: *
< pb-req-accept: */*
< pb-req-content-length: 4
< pb-req-content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
< pb-req-user-agent: curl/7.67.0
< pb-uri: /req/i3ia-je5s
< content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< content-length: 4
< date: Thu, 12 Dec 2019 19:23:16 GMT
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Notice that some of these headers are prepended with "pb-". These
        headers are actually originally passed from the requester to patchbay.
        They can be easily parsed to determine all the information we need
        about the client request.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may already see the problem. By the time curl prints out those
        headers, the responder has already exited and the connection with the
        requester is gone forever, so there's no way to use the information.
        In order to get around this, we use a technique we call
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_clutch_(technique)">"double clutch"</a>
        requests. It works because patchbay implements a responder query
        param switch=true. If set, rather than connecting the responder
        directly to the requester, patchbay switches the requester to whatever
        channel (usually random) the responder specifies in its body, and
        returns the requester path/headers/etc to the responder. The requester
        remains blocked on the new channel, until the responder makes a
        <em>second</em> request, after having processed the request info, and
        they are patched together as usual.  Ok that's kind of a lot. It's not
        as bad as it sounds. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically you start with a responder waiting with something it wants
        to serve:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl 'https://patchbay.pub/res/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span>?switch=true' -d "myrandomchannel" -v
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Then a requester comes along:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/req/<span class='channel'>acgt1234</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        The responder exits immediately, but the requester is now waiting on
        myrandomchannel. The responder can process the request, then complete
        the transaction by POSTing to the random channel it specified in the
        first request:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/myrandomchannel -d "Final response"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Obviously this isn't very useful with curl. But it's straight-forward
        to build full web servers around it in less than 150 lines of code. See
        for example
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/patchbay-pub/patchbay-http-js">patchbay-http-js</a>
        and
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/patchbay-pub/patchbay-browser-responder">patchbay-browser-responder</a>
        (which lets you host files from your browser!).
